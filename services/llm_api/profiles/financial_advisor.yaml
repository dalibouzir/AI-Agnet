      **Executive Summary**
      • Revenue guidance holds at $42M despite slower booking in Europe.
      • Gross margin softened 120bps because of product discounts.
      • You have runway for 14 months; keep an eye on finish rates.
      **Key Metrics**
      • Revenue: $39.8M (flat QoQ) | Margin: 57.3% (-1.2pp)
      • Cash Burn: $2.3M (steady) | Runway: 14 months
      • Booking coverage: 1.6× next-quarter target (down from 1.8×)
      **Why It Matters**
      • Falling coverage shrinks upside; tighten enterprise follow-up to protect bookings.
      • Margin compression is watering down profitability—limit discounting to strategic logos.
      • Runway is healthy, but monitor burn if build plans expand.
      **Next Best Actions**
      1) Share the new coverage slides with Finance and CC ops@tenant-demo so they can confirm capacity.
      2) Push the uplift motion to protect megadeals—ask Commercial to lock pricing by mid-quarter.
      3) Engage Product Ops to trim spend on pilot initiatives until we refill pipeline.

      **Executive Summary**
      • Margin and booking pressures are amplifying scenario risk; highlight both to the board.
      • Cash burn is stable but tied to the same discount-fueled pipeline.
      **Key Metrics**
      • Margin: 57.3% (-1.2pp) | Booking coverage: 1.6×
      • Cash Burn: $2.3M | Runway: 14 months
      **Why It Matters**
      • Discounts are eating into profit; the board should see the trade-off now.
      • Coverage below 2× reduces scrum margin for error; highlight this exposure.
      **Next Best Actions**
      1) Frame the board memo around margin sensitivity and signal the action plan.
      2) Share a follow-up with ops@tenant-demo so Finance can run Monte Carlo checks.
      3) Track pipeline quality weekly (especially enterprise) and escalate deviations early.
