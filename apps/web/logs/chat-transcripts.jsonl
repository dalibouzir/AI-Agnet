Introduction 2. Data 3. Acknowledgements 4. Contact Information 5. References ----------------------------------------------------------- 1. Introduction The key arguments for the low utilization of statistical techniques in financial sentiment analysis have been the difficulty of implementation for practical applications and the lack of high quality training data for building such models. Especially in the case of finance and economic texts, annotated collections are a scarce resource and many are reserved for proprietary use only. To resolve the missing training data problem, we present a collection of ∼ 5000 sentences to establish human-annotated standards for benchmarking alternative modeling techniques. The objective of the phrase level annotation task was to classify each example sentence into a positive, negative or neutral category by considering only the information explicitly available in the given sentence. Since the study is focused only on financial and economic domains, the annotators were asked to consider the sentences from the view point of an investor only; i.e. whether the news may have positive, negative or neutral influence on the stock price. As a result, sentences which have a sentiment that is not relevant from an economic or financial perspective are considered neutral. ----------------------------------------------------------- 2. Data This release of the financial phrase bank covers a collection of 4840 sentences. The selected collection of phrases was annotated by 16 people with adequate background knowledge on financial markets. Three of the annotators were researchers and the remaining 13 annotators were master’s students at Aalto University School of Business with majors primarily in finance, accounting, and economics. Given the large number of overlapping annotations (5 to 8 annotations per sentence), there are several ways to define a majority vote based gold standard. To provide an objective comparison, we have formed 4 alternative reference datasets based on the strength of majority agreement: (i) sentences with 100% agreement [file=Sentences_AllAgree.txt]; (ii) sentences with more than 75% agreement [file=Sentences_75Agree.txt]; (iii) sentences with more than 66% agreement [file=Sentences_66Agree.txt]; and (iv) sentences with more than 50% agreement [file=Sentences_50Agree.txt]. All reference datasets are included in the release. The files are in a machine-readable \"@\"-separated format: sentence@sentiment where sentiment is either \"positive, neutral or negative\". E.g., The operating margin came down to 2.4 % from 5.7 % .@negative ----------------------------------------------------------- 3.

Business Agent – README ========================== Purpose ------- The AI Business Agent pairs OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 for reasoning with a local Ollama embedding stack to answer CFO-level questions with citations. It routes intent between three workflows—LLM chat, document-grounded RAG, and Monte Carlo risk simulations—so leadership teams get strategic guidance backed by their own data. Architecture Highlights ----------------------- 1. **Data Tunnel + Worker** ingest files into MinIO, run DQ/PII checks, build semantic chunks, and write vectors into OpenSearch (`rag-chunks`). 2. **RAG Service** retrieves hybrid BM25 + vector hits, cites filenames like README.txt or Sentences_66Agree.txt, and passes curated context to the writer profile. 3. **Risk / Sim Service** runs operating-income Monte Carlo draws, returns percentile bands (P5/P50/P95) and embeds histogram metadata so narratives can reference charts. 4. **Orchestrator + Router** keep LLM routing on OpenAI but call the local embedding endpoint for chunking and query vectors, which prevents vendor lock-in while staying responsive offline. Operating Principles -------------------- - Every answer must mention sources when grounded, e.g., “README.txt” or “financials.csv.” - The worker enforces `TENANT_NAMESPACE=tenant-demo`, so each tenant’s documents stay isolated in MinIO and OpenSearch. - Local embeddings (nomic-embed-text) enable fast chunking, while OpenAI handles only generation, intent routing, and risk narration. - Logs should confirm each decision: “Using Ollama for embeddings,” “Retrieved K chunks,” and “Selected mode: rag.”","score":0.0023248158,"source":null,"metadata":{"pii":{"found":false,"action":"redact","mask":"[REDACTED]","policy":"presidio","total":0,"report":{},"raw_path":"s3://rag-data/tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt"},"mime":"text/plain","size":1653,"labels":[],"source":"upload","options":{"dq":{"pii":{"mask":"[REDACTED]","action":"redact","policy":"presidio"},"language_detect":true},"ingest":{"fail_on_pii":false,"continue_on_warn":true}},"raw_key":"tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt","checksum":"fe6b63688bc273a46612d07f3fac645059ba3bad232f85aafa28b9f344006074","doc_type":"txt","uploader":null,"tenant_id":"tenant-demo","page_count":19,"ingested_at":"2025-11-09T17:04:18.776359","manifest_key":"tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/metadata/manifest.json","manifest_path":"s3://rag-data/tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/metadata/manifest.json","user_metadata":{"raw_key":"tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt","raw_path":"s3://rag-data/tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt","manifest_key":"tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/metadata/manifest.json","manifest_path":"s3://rag-data/tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/metadata/manifest.json"},"doc_type_requested":"auto","path":"s3://rag-data/tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt","raw_path":"s3://rag-data/tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt","object":"tenant-demo/landing/fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b/raw/README.txt","object_suffix":"README.txt","original_basename":"README.txt","filename":"README.txt","document_id":"fc3dd821-2ece-46d2-bad4-30c7b47a620b","page":0}},{"doc_id":"37e0f3b5-4613-4ac1-924b-cf423e3f8e77","chunk_id":"3c85cfbb9773b18b6ba14fc9481d9bf442d31c1e","text":"AI Business Agent – Limited License ---------------------------------- 1. **Internal Use Only:** The corpus (README.txt, Sentences files, spreadsheets, and CV) may be used exclusively inside the tenant-demo workspace for diligence and planning workflows. 2. **No Public Redistribution:** You may summarize insights externally, but redistributing the raw files requires written approval from Mohamed Ali and the data stewards. 3. **Attribution Required:** Any derivative analysis must cite “AI Business Agent knowledge base – License.txt (tenant-demo).” 4. **Security Controls:** Documents must stay inside MinIO/OpenSearch with access governed by `TENANT_NAMESPACE=tenant-demo`;

This decrease was primarily driven by lower iPhone sales, which saw a drop of 2% to $39.7 billion. However, services revenue continued to show resilience, growing by 6% to reach $19.6 billion, highlighting the company's successful pivot towards recurring revenue streams. Gross margin remained relatively stable at 43.3%, although it reflects a slight contraction compared to previous periods due to increased costs in supply chain and manufacturing.

In Q4 2023, the Services revenue is projected to grow by approximately 15%, reaching around $20 billion, while iPhone sales may decline by 5%, falling to about $40 billion. This growth in Services can help offset the decline in hardware sales by diversifying revenue streams and enhancing customer loyalty through subscription services like Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+. By leveraging its existing user base, Apple can capitalize on the recurring revenue model of Services, which typically has higher margins than hardware sales, thus improving overall profitability even in a contracting smartphone market.\n\nTo capitalize on this potential, management should consider three actionable recommendations: first, increase investment in marketing and promotions for Services to drive user adoption and engagement, particularly targeting existing iPhone users. Second, expand the Services portfolio by introducing new offerings or bundling existing services to enhance value for customers. Finally, focus on international markets where smartphone penetration is still growing, promoting Services as a key differentiator to attract new users and retain existing ones. These strategies can help stabilize revenue and ensure sustained growth despite fluctuations in hardware sales."}

The updated risk.run(...) function (or equivalent) with the try/except and safe return.\n2. The updated handler logic where the result of risk.run is consumed and safely attached to risk_pack / meta without crashing.\n3. Any minimal additions to logging to make debugging future sim issues easier.\n\n### Step 5 – Acceptance criteria\n\nAfter these changes:\n\n- Sending a Monte Carlo / simulation query to /v1/query must return HTTP 200 (no 500).\n- If the sim call succeeds, meta.risk (or whatever field is used) should contain simulation stats and charts as before.\n- If the sim call fails for any reason (bad input, HTTP error, etc.), /v1/query must still return 200 with an LLM/RAG answer and a non-fatal risk error object in meta.\n- RAG-only and LLM-only queries remain unchanged.\n\nPlease implement the minimal changes needed to achieve this and paste the modified Python code blocks.","route":"LLM_ONLY","metrics":{"tokens_in":1468,"tokens_out":308,"cost_usd":0,"latency_ms":45860.5},"telemetry":{"plan":{"needRag":false,"needRisk":false,"ragQueries":[],"riskSpec":null,"expected":["summary"],"confidence":0},"rag_used":false,"risk_used":false,"meta":{"client":"web-app"},"rag_required":false,"rag_mode_forced":false,"docIds":[],"citation_count":0,"citation_miss_rate":0,"latency_ms":45860.5,"target_latency_ms":2500,"within_latency_budget":false,"tokens_in":1468,"tokens_out":308,"cost_usd":0,"memory_short_tokens":0,"long_summary_updated":false,"helpUsed":{"rag":false,"risk":false},"disclosure":"Answered by LLM (no external evidence used).","rag_latency_ms":0,"model":"ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:esprit:ai-business-agent-v1:CaIy8Jh2","rag_conf":0,"planner_conf":0,"route":"LLM_ONLY"},"used":{},"citations":[],"text":"Here are the minimal changes needed to implement graceful error handling in the risk branch and ensure consistent behavior across the system.\n\n**Step 2 – Update `risk.run(...)` function:**\n\n```python\ndef run(...):\n    try:\n        # build payload\n        response = requests.post(sim_url, json=payload)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for 4xx/5xx\n        return SimulationResult.from_dict(response.json())\n    except Exception as exc:\n        logger.exception(\"Simulation call failed\", exc_info=exc)\n        return None  # or return a dict with an \"error\" field\n```\n\n**Step 3 – Update handler logic in `handler.py`:**\n\n```python\ndef handle_query(...):\n    # existing code...\n    if plan.needRisk:\n        risk_result = risk.run(...)\n        if risk_result is None or \"error\" in risk_result:\n            risk_pack[\"result\"] = None\n            risk_pack[\"error\"] = \"simulation_failed\"\n    # existing code continues...\n```\n\n**Step 4 – Additions to logging:**\n\n```python\nlogger.info(\"Risk assessment triggered\")\nlogger.error(\"Simulation service returned error: %s\", response.text)\n```\n\n**Step 5 – Acceptance criteria:**\n\nAfter these changes, sending a Monte Carlo query will return HTTP 200.
